# StateEye
StateEye, an intelligent web-testing tool inspired by the FRAGGEN approach.
# Project Description:
Web applications are frequently updated with new designs, buttons and features. These updates can unintentionally break existing functions and manually checking everything each time is slow and error-prone.<br>
This project introduces <b>StateEye</b>, an intelligent web-testing tool inspired by the <b>FRAGGEN</b> approach. StateEye automatically analyzes websites after updates to ensure everything still works properly. It explores the website like a real user, interacts with different sections and observes how each part responds. Instead of comparing entire pages, StateEye divides them into smaller sections and checks for meaningful changes more precisely.<br>
A key advantage of StateEye is its ability to identify pages that look almost the same but differ slightly in data or structure. By recognizing these <b>near-duplicate</b> states, it avoids redundant testing and focuses only on meaningful differences, saving both time and effort.<br>
StateEye also generates reusable test cases automatically from its exploration, allowing future updates to be verified quickly and consistently. It intelligently ignores minor layout or color changes while highlighting real functional issues.<br>
To assist manual testers, StateEye includes a browser plugin that marks <b>tested and untested</b> areas and suggests the next steps, making testing faster, smarter and more reliable while helping developers maintain stable, high-quality websites with ease.
